"Day of the Sporebirth
Visions have plagued my dreams again, vivid and commanding. The Great Moander speaks to me from the beyond, his voice a whisper among the shadows, guiding my hands towards a grand purpose. He commands me to awaken the earth, to breathe life into the dormant spores that slumber in the dark. 'Spread the fungi,' he whispers, 'let them devour the knowledge of the world.' So I set out from Torsch in Chondalwood and made the long journey north, as my visions had sent me to the city of Baldur's Gate on the Sword Coast.

Day of the Hyphal Expansion
The cultivation progresses. My children, the fungi, thrive in the darkness of my sanctuary. Each species, a key to unlocking the chains that bind my lord. Today, a new species bloomed, its spores glittering like stars in the void. They hunger for the written word, an appetite that rivals even my own zeal. With every book they consume, I feel Moander's presence strengthening, his resurrection imminent.

Day of the Waxing Convergence
A breakthrough in my work. The spores can now dissolve ink and parchment with alarming efficiency. My dreams are more vivid now; Moander's voice grows clearer. He shows me a world free of the burden of past knowledge, a world ripe for his rule. I am to be his herald, the one who paves the path for his return. The old must be eradicated for the new to bloom.

Day of the Fruiting Emergence
Doubt creeps into my heart today. A momentary weakness, mayhap. The destruction I wreak feels overwhelming, erasing centuries of wisdom and history. But then I remember my purpose, the divine command. Moander's will is absolute; his vision for the future, infallible. I am but a servant, chosen to execute his grand design. The loss of knowledge is a necessary sacrifice for rebirth.

Day of the Spore Dissemination
Tonight, my dreams were different. Not a vision, but a visitation. The Voidspeakers, creatures of great intelligence and power, reached out to me. They spoke of a partnership, of shared goals and mutual benefits. Moander's voice was silent tonight, but the message was clear. These beings, with their unfathomable minds, are the key to my lord's resurrection. They guide me, not as false prophets, but as allies in the great awakening. They allowed me to gaze into the pool and gain a glimpse of what Moander wants to transform.

Day of Mold Colonization
I managed to get the rusty cauldron in the old temple working again. It's a 'Cauldron of Doom', a fabled item that allows me to create zombies when I throw a corpse into the vat! My fellow allies, the Voidspeakers, don't seem to like the fact that I'm summoning undead - but why?

Day of the Waning Decomposition 
I see now the grand tapestry of Moander's plan, woven with threads of deceit and truth alike. The Voidspeakers are but instruments in his resurrection, their goals aligning with his divine will. I am to continue my work, spreading the decay, until the day comes when Moander walks this realm once more. My faith is unshaken, my purpose clear. The end of knowledge is the beginning of enlightenment."
~
@1049 = ~Codex Sporogenesis~
@1050 = ~Codex Sporogenesis: Unveiling the Secrets of Decay

The following rare spores and molds are ideal for knowledge eradication:

Voidcap Fungus
Found thriving in the deepest shadows, the Voidcap Fungus resembles a void in the very fabric of reality. Its caps absorb light, making them appear as dark, bottomless pits. When ingested, the spores induce visions of endless nothingness, a glimpse into the abyss that awaits to consume the world’s knowledge. They are the heralds of silence, devouring the words and memories that dare to defy the coming oblivion.

Shadowspore Mold
This creeping mold grows like a sinister shadow over anything that bears the mark of civilization's pride - books, scrolls, and tomes. The Shadowspore Mold feeds on the ink, leaving behind nothing but blank pages, as if the knowledge never existed. In its presence, one can hear faint whispers, the dying breaths of lost knowledge, a testament to Moander's will to reclaim and obliterate the structures of the known.

Mindrot Fungus
The Mindrot Fungus is a rare and dangerous species, thriving on the psychic energies of sentient beings. Its spores cloud the mind, slowly dissolving memories and knowledge, leaving behind only a hollow shell. It's not just the physical manifestation of decay but the very essence of forgetting, an agent of Moander's desire to erase the sins of the past and make the world anew.

Whispering Mycelium
A network of fine, almost invisible threads, the Whispering Mycelium spreads beneath the earth of ancient libraries and sacred places of learning. It communicates in hushed tones, spreading secrets and lies that sow doubt and discord. Those who listen too closely find their thoughts not their own, as the mycelium weaves new truths from the fabric of forgotten lies. It is the voice of Moander, spreading his gospel of decay through the very roots of civilization.~

Mission Directive: Operation Mindshroud

To the esteemed agents of the Loretaker Creed,
By the mandate of the Encephalithid, we are tasked with the sacred duty of eradicating the remnants of knowledge that cling to the feeble minds of the surface dwellers. Our target: The prestigious libraries of Baldur's Gate and the sacred repository of Candlekeep.

Our mission is twofold:
- Infiltration and Infestation: Utilize our agents disguised among the humanoid masses to infiltrate the libraries of Baldur's Gate. Under the cover of darkness, use minions to infest tomes, scrolls, and manuscripts with the Shadowspore Mold, ensuring that every word, every symbol is consumed by the creeping darkness of oblivion. Let no volume be spared in our quest to purge the world of the shackles of knowledge.

- Propagation of Decay: Once the infection has taken root within the heart of Baldur's Gate, transport the tainted texts to the hallowed halls of Candlekeep. Under the guise of trade or diplomatic exchange, introduce the corrupted tomes into the sacred library's collection. Let the spores of decay spread unchecked, unraveling the threads of history and wisdom that bind the minds of the surface dwellers.

- Keep mind contact with the others of our kind, especially the Hidden further south.

Remember the creed of our kin: "In the absence of knowledge, there is only enlightenment." In the annihilation of the past lies the promise of a new dawn, where the supremacy of the Illithid shall reign unchallenged.

Install the Elder Brain Transceiver in a remote location to maintain contact with the Encephalithid. Use your brainmate to activate the transceiver.
May the Encephalithid guide your thoughts, and may the whispers of the Voidspeakers herald your victory.

Inside the chamber, users typically find items of significant arcane power or ancient scrolls that are preserved in a near-perfect state, safeguarded by the sphere's intricate design.

Using a rare sapphire that was mined from the depths of the Anauroch desert, a region once lush and verdant before the desert claimed it, Arthindol infused the gem with potent wards. It was said to fortify the wearer’s resolve, shielding them from fears both mundane and magical. Moreover, it provided an impenetrable defense against all forms of charm and compulsion, rendering the bearer immune to the wiles of both fey enchanters and fiendish manipulators.
